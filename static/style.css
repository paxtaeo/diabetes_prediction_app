/**
 * Custom CSS for Diabetes Prediction Application
 *
 * This file contains minimal custom CSS for features not easily achievable
 * with Tailwind utility classes alone (primarily animations).
 *
 * Educational Note:
 * ----------------
 * We use Tailwind CSS for most styling because:
 * 1. It provides consistent, well-designed utility classes
 * 2. It reduces the amount of custom CSS we need to write
 * 3. It makes the HTML more maintainable (styles are visible in markup)
 * 4. It enforces design system constraints (spacing, colors, etc.)
 *
 * However, some things like custom animations are better defined in CSS.
 * This file contains those exceptions.

   Custom Animations
   ============================================================================ */

/**
 * Slide-in animation for result and error displays
 *
 * This animation creates a smooth reveal effect when results appear,
 * improving the user experience by drawing attention to new content.
 */
@keyframes slideIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-20px);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}

/* Apply the animation to elements with the slide-in class */
.slide-in {
    animation: slideIn 0.4s ease-out;
}

/**
 * Spinner rotation animation for loading states
 *
 * This creates a smooth, continuous spinning effect for the loading indicator.
 * The animation is hardware-accelerated using CSS transforms for better performance.
 *
 * Educational Note:
 * ----------------
 * We use 'transform' instead of animating position properties because:
 * 1. Transform animations are GPU-accelerated (smoother performance)
 * 2. They don't trigger layout reflows (better for battery life)
 * 3. Linear timing function creates constant rotation speed

   Custom Utility Classes
   ============================================================================ */

 *
 * While Tailwind has a 'hidden' class, we define it here for clarity
 * and to ensure it's available even if Tailwind CDN fails to load.

/* ============================================================================
   Gradient Text (Optional Enhancement)
   ============================================================================ */

 * Gradient text effect
 *
 * This creates a gradient color effect on text, which isn't easily
 * achievable with Tailwind utilities alone.
 */

   Notes for Students
   ============================================================================

   Tailwind CSS Integration:
   ------------------------
   Most of the styling for this application is done using Tailwind utility
   classes directly in the HTML. This file only contains:

   1. Custom animations that would be verbose to define inline
   2. Complex effects not available in Tailwind utilities
   3. Fallback styles in case Tailwind CDN is unavailable

   To customize the appearance:
   ---------------------------
   1. For colors, spacing, sizes: Modify Tailwind classes in index.html
   2. For animations: Modify this file
   3. For completely custom effects: Add them to this file

   Tailwind Documentation:
   ----------------------
   For a complete list of Tailwind utility classes, see:
